Case Study
Domain – Automotive
focus – Incentivize drivers
Business challenge/requirement
Lithionpower is the largest provider of electric vehicle(e-vehicle) batteries. It provides battery on a rental model to e-vehicle drivers. Drivers rent battery typically for a day and then replace it with a charged battery from the company.
Lithionpower has a variable pricing model based on driver's driving history. As the life of a battery depends on factors such as overspeeding, distance driven per day etc.
You as a ML expert have to create a cluster model where drivers can be grouped together based on the driving data.

Key issues:
Drivers will be incentivized based on the cluster, so grouping has to be accurate


CaseStudy-3

1.Load the file “zoo.data” and look at the info and first five rows. The first column denotes the animal name and the last one specifies a high-level class for the corresponding animal.

2. Find out the unique number of high level class.

3. Use the 16-intermediate feature and perform an agglomerative clustering.
[ Hint: Refer to the agglomerative clustering module in scikit learn and set the number of clusters appropriately]

4. Compute the mean squared error by comparing the actual class and predicted high level class.
